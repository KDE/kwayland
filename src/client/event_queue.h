 * @short Wrapper class for wl_event_queue interface.
 *
 * The EventQueue is needed if a different thread is used for the connection.
 * If the interface wrappers are held in a different thread than the connection thread
 * an EventQueue is needed for the thread which holds the interface wrappers. A common
 * example is a dedicated connection thread while the interface wrappers are created
 * in the main thread.
 *
 * All interface wrappers are set up to support the EventQueue in the most convenient
 * way. The EventQueue needs only to be passed to the Registry. The EventQueue will then
 * be passed to all created wrappers through the tree.
 *
 * @code
 * ConnectionThread connection;
 * EventQueue queue;
 * Registry registry;
 *
 * connect(&connection, &ConnectionThread::connected, this, [&] {
 *     queue.setup(&connection);
 *     registry.setEventQueue(&queue);
 *     registry.setup(&connection);
 *     registry.create();
 * });
 *
 * connection.initConnection();
 * @endcode
 *
 * The EventQueue can be used as a drop-in replacement for any wl_event_queue
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
