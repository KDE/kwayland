/** @class OutputConfigurationInterface
 *
 * Holds a new configuration for the outputs.
 *
 * The overall mechanism is to get a new OutputConfiguration from the OutputManagement global and
 * apply changes through the OutputConfiguration::set* calls. When all changes are set, the client
 * calls apply, which asks the server to look at the changes and apply them. The server will then
 * signal back whether the changes have been applied successfully (@c setApplied()) or were rejected
 * or failed to apply (@c setFailed()).
 *
 * Once the client has called applied, the OutputManagementInterface send the configuration object
 * to the compositor through the OutputManagement::configurationChangeRequested(OutputConfiguration*)
 * signal, the compositor can then decide what to do with the changes.
 *
 * These KWayland classes will not apply changes to the OutputDevices, this is the compositor's
 * task. As such, the configuration set through this interface can be seen as a hint what the
 * compositor should set up, but whether or not the compositor does it (based on hardware or
 * rendering policies, for example), is up to the compositor. The mode setting is passed on to
 * the DRM subsystem through the compositor. The compositor also saves this configuration and reads
 * it on startup, this interface is not involved in that process.
