 * @short Wrapper for the wl_subsurface interface.
 *
 * This class is a convenient wrapper for the wl_subsurface interface.
 * To create a SubSurface call SubCompositor::createSubSurface.
 *
 * A SubSurface is bound to a Surface and has a parent Surface.
 * A SubSurface can only be created for a Surface not already used in onther way,
 * e.g. as a ShellSurface.
 *
 * The SubSurface has a position in local coordinates to the parent Surface.
 * Please note that changing the position is a double buffered state and is only
 * applied once the parent surface is committed. The same applies for manipulating
 * the stacking order of the SubSurface's siblings.
