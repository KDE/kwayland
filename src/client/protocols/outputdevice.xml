<interface name="org_kde_kwin_outputdevice" version="1">
    <description summary="compositor output region">
        An outputdevice describes a physical monitor connected to the system.
        outputdevice is similar to wl_output, but focuses on screen
        management. The screen configuration client uses outputdevices to
        enlist connected devices, even those that may currently not be used
        by the compositor as wl_output. It sends configuration changes to the
        compositor through the outputconfiguration interface, which applies the
        settings to the hardware and signals changes the outputdevices
        accordingly.
        This object is published as global during start up, or when a monitor
        is hotplugged.

            This describes the transform that a compositor will apply to a

            output device.

            The flipped values correspond to an initial flip around a
            vertical axis followed by rotation.

            The purpose is mainly to allow clients render accordingly and
            tell the compositor, so that for fullscreen surfaces, the
            compositor will still be able to scan out directly from client
            surfaces.

    <event name="mode">
        <description summary="advertise available modes for the output">
            The mode event describes an available mode for the output.

            The event is sent when binding to the output object and there
            will always be one mode, the current mode.  The event is sent
            again if an output changes mode, for the mode that is now
            current.  In other words, the current mode is always the last
            mode that was received with the current flag set.

            The size of a mode is given in physical hardware units of
            the output device. This is not necessarily the same as
            the output size in the global compositor space. For instance,
            the output may be scaled, as described in org_kde_kwin_outputdevice.scale,
            or transformed , as described in org_kde_kwin_outputdevice.transform.

            The id can be used to refer to a mode when calling
            set_mode on a org_kde_kwin_outputonfiguration.

            This event is sent after all other properties has been
            sent after binding to the output object and after any
            other property changes done after that. This allows
            changes to the output properties to be seen as
            atomic, even if they happen via multiple events.

    <event name="scale">
        <description summary="output scaling properties">
            This event contains scaling geometry information
            that is not in the geometry event. It may be sent after
            binding the output object or if the output scale changes
            later. If it is not sent, the client should assume a
            scale of 1.

            A scale larger than 1 means that the compositor will
            automatically scale surface buffers by this amount
            when rendering. This is used for very high resolution
            displays where applications rendering at the native
            resolution would be too small to be legible.

            It is intended that scaling aware clients track the
            current output of a surface, and if it is on a scaled
            output it should use wl_surface.set_buffer_scale with
            the scale of the output. That way the compositor can
            avoid scaling the surface, and the client can supply
            a higher detail image.

            The event is sent when binding to the output object. The EDID
            data may be empty, in which case this event is fired, anyway.
            If the EDID information is empty, you can fall back to the name
            et al. properties.

            The data argument can be used to decode custom EDID extensions.
