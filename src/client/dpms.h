 * @short This class is a factory for Dpms instances.
 *
 * It is a convenience wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_dpms_manager interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the DpmsManager interface:
 * @code
 * DpmsManager *m = registry->createDpmsManager(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the DpmsManager and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * DpmsManager *m = new DpmsManager;
 * m->setup(registry->bindDpmsManager(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The DpmsManager can be used as a drop-in replacement for any org_kde_kwin_dpms_manager
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry, Dpms
 * @since 5.5
