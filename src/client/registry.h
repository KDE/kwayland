/**
 * @short Wrapper for the wl_registry interface.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to manage the wl_registry interface.
 * This class supports some well-known interfaces and can create a
 * wrapper class for those.
 *
 * The main purpose is to emit signals whenever a new interface is
 * added or an existing interface is removed. For the well known interfaces
 * dedicated signals are emitted allowing a user to connect directly to the
 * signal announcing the interface it is interested in.
 *
 * To create and setup the Registry one needs to call create with either a
 * wl_display from an existing Wayland connection or a ConnectionThread instance:
 *
 * @code
 * ConnectionThread *connection; // existing connection
 * Registry registry;
 * registry.create(connection);
 * registry.setup();
 * @endcode
 *
 * The interfaces are announced in an asynchronous way by the Wayland server.
 * To initiate the announcing of the interfaces one needs to call setup.
