/**
 * @short Wrapper for the zxdg_decoration_manager_v1 interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the zxdg_decoration_manager_v1 interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the XdgDecorationManager interface:
 * @code
 * XdgDecorationManager *c = registry->createXdgDecorationManager(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the XdgDecorationManager and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * XdgDecorationManager *c = new XdgDecorationManager;
 * c->setup(registry->bindXdgDecorationManager(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The XdgDecorationManager can be used as a drop-in replacement for any zxdg_decoration_manager_v1
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * If you use the QtWayland QPA you do not need to use this class.
 *
 * @see Registry
 * @since 5.54
