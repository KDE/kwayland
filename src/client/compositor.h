/**
 * @short Wrapper for the wl_compositor interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the wl_compositor interface.
 * It's main purpose is to create a Surface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the Compositor interface:
 * @code
 * Compositor *c = registry->createCompositor(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the Compositor and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * Compositor *c = new Compositor;
 * c->setup(registry->bindCompositor(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The Compositor can be used as a drop-in replacement for any wl_compositor
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry
