/** @class OutputConfiguration
 *
 * OutputConfiguration provides access to changing OutputDevices. The interface is async
 * and atomic. An OutputConfiguration is created through OutputManagement::createConfiguration().
 *
 * The overall mechanism is to get a new OutputConfiguration from the OutputManagement global and
 * apply changes through the OutputConfiguration::set* calls. When all changes are set, the client
 * calls apply, which asks the server to look at the changes and apply them. The server will then
 * signal back whether the changes have been applied successfully (@c applied()) or were rejected
 * or failed to apply (@c failed()).
 *
 * The current settings for outputdevices can be gotten from @c Registry::outputDevices(), these
 * are used in the set* calls to identify the output the setting applies to.
 *
 * These KWayland classes will not apply changes to the OutputDevices, this is the compositor's
 * task. As such, the configuration set through this interface can be seen as a hint what the
 * compositor should set up, but whether or not the compositor does it (based on hardware or
 * rendering policies, for example), is up to the compositor. The mode setting is passed on to
 * the DRM subsystem through the compositor. The compositor also saves this configuration and reads
 * it on startup, this interface is not involved in that process.
 *
 * @c apply() should only be called after changes to all output devices have been made, not after
 * each change. This allows to test the new configuration as a whole, and is a lot faster since
 * hardware changes can be tested in their new combination, they done in parallel.and rolled back
 * as a whole.
 *

    // We're just picking the first of our outputdevices
    KWayland::Client::OutputDevice *output = m_clientOutputs.first();

    // Create a new configuration object
    auto config = m_outputManagement.createConfiguration();

    // handle applied and failed signals
    connect(config, &OutputConfiguration::applied, []() {
        qDebug() << "Configuration applied!";
    });
    connect(config, &OutputConfiguration::failed, []() {
        qDebug() << "Configuration failed!";
    });

    // Change settings
    config->setMode(output, m_clientOutputs.first()->modes().last().id);
    config->setTransform(output, OutputDevice::Transform::Normal);
    config->setPosition(output, QPoint(0, 1920));
    config->setScale(output, 2);

    // Now ask the compositor to apply the changes
    config->apply();
    // You may wait for the applied() or failed() signal here
