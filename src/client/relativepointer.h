/**
 * @short Wrapper for the zwp_relative_pointer_manager_v1 interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the zwp_relative_pointer_manager_v1 interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the RelativePointerManager interface:
 * @code
 * RelativePointerManager *c = registry->createRelativePointerManagerUnstableV1(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the RelativePointerManager and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * RelativePointerManager *c = new RelativePointerManager;
 * c->setup(registry->RelativePointerManager(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The RelativePointerManager can be used as a drop-in replacement for any zwp_relative_pointer_manager_v1
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry
 * @since 5.28

     * A relative motion event.
     *
     * A relative motion is in the same dimension as regular motion events,
     * except they do not represent an absolute position. For example,
     * moving a pointer from (x, y) to (x', y') would have the equivalent
     * relative motion (x' - x, y' - y). If a pointer motion caused the
     * absolute pointer position to be clipped by for example the edge of the
     * monitor, the relative motion is unaffected by the clipping and will
     * represent the unclipped motion.
     *
     * This signal also contains non-accelerated motion deltas (@p deltaNonAccelerated).
     * The non-accelerated delta is, when applicable, the regular pointer motion
     * delta as it was before having applied motion acceleration and other
     * transformations such as normalization.
     *
     * Note that the non-accelerated delta does not represent 'raw' events as
     * they were read from some device. Pointer motion acceleration is device-
     * and configuration-specific and non-accelerated deltas and accelerated
     * deltas may have the same value on some devices.
     *
     * Relative motions are not coupled to Pointer motion events,
     * and can be sent in combination with such events, but also independently. There may
     * also be scenarios where Pointer motion is sent, but there is no
     * relative motion. The order of an absolute and relative motion event
     * originating from the same physical motion is not guaranteed.
