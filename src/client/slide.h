/**
 * @short Wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_slide_manager interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_slide_manager interface.
 *
 * Ask the compositor to move the surface from a location
 * to another with a slide animation.
 *
 * The from argument provides a clue about where the slide
 * animation begins, offset is the distance from screen
 * edge to begin the animation.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the SlideManager interface:
 * @code
 * SlideManager *c = registry->createSlideManager(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the SlideManager and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * SlideManager *c = new SlideManager;
 * c->setup(registry->bindSlideManager(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The SlideManager can be used as a drop-in replacement for any org_kde_kwin_slide_manager
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry
