/**
 * @short Exposes the window list and window state as a Qt item model.
 *
 * This class is a QAbstractListModel implementation that exposes information
 * from a PlasmaWindowManagement instance passed as parent and enables convenient
 * calls to PlasmaWindow methods through a model row index.
 *
 * The model is destroyed when the PlasmaWindowManagement parent is.
 *
 * The model resets when the PlasmaWindowManagement parent signals that its
 * interface is about to be destroyed.
 *
 * To use this class you can create an instance yourself, or preferrably use the
 * convenience method in PlasmaWindowManagement:
 * @code
 * PlasmaWindowModel *model = wm->createWindowModel();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see PlasmaWindowManagement
 * @see PlasmaWindow
