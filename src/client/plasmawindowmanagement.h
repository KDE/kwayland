/**
 * @short Wrapper for the org_kde_plasma_window_management interface.
 *
 * PlasmaWindowManagement is a privileged interface. A Wayland compositor is allowed to ignore
 * any requests. The PlasmaWindowManagement allows to get information about the overall windowing
 * system. It allows to see which windows are currently available and thus is the base to implement
 * e.g. a task manager.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the org_kde_plasma_window_management interface.
 * It's main purpose is to create a PlasmaWindowManagementSurface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the Shell interface:
 * @code
 * PlasmaWindowManagement *s = registry->createPlasmaWindowManagement(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the PlasmaWindowManagement and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * PlasmaWindowManagement *s = new PlasmaWindowManagement;
 * s->setup(registry->bindPlasmaWindowManagement(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The PlasmaWindowManagement can be used as a drop-in replacement for any org_kde_plasma_window_management
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.

 * @see PlasmaWindowManagementSurface
