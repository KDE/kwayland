  <interface name="org_kde_kwin_output_management" version="1">
    <description summary="list connected, but disabled outputs">
    This interface allows to connected output devices for screen configuration purposes.

    - keep protocol flat for simplicity, use id to tell which output this signal refers to
    - provide info about all outputs, per OutputDevice:

    events:
    - outputdevice_added
        - id (unique int, only handed out by kwin, used to identify and refer to an OD throughout the protocol)
        - resolution: resX, resY
        - position: posX, posY
        - orientation: degree
        - primary: bool
        - enabled: bool
    - modes: width, height, refresh_rate (separate signal)
    - edid: eisa_id, monitor_name, serial_number, physical_width, physical_height (separate signal)
    - outputdevice_removed: id

    methods:
    - per outputdevice:
        - set enabled
        - set mode
        - set orientation
        - set position
        - set primary
    - apply: client is done sending set* calls, "dear compositor, please apply the settings now"


    server:
        - wayland_server.cpp gets a OutputManagement interface
        - initOutputs also triggers events in the screenmanagement interface
        - announces the outputs on the OutputManagementInterface when bound
        - sends device announced, edid and mode callbacks in order
        - solely responsible for handing out ids
        - is responsible for state changes through backends
        - decides what to do with the information

    client:
        - connects to server
        - receives the info about all the outputs
        - ignores wl_output otherwise
        - can set properties of outputs (enable/disable, mode, position, etc.)

    why?
        - keeps everything in one place
        - one interface for a specific purpose
        - bi-directional, so defined config interface, no config writing/picking up etc.
        - one place to housekeep ids
        - interface is purpose-made, not trying to shoe-horn kscreen in and around wl_output
        - server really seems to be the right place to keep state and logic
        - makes concertation less complex, since there's exactly one place to handle state, like mode, on/off, etc.
