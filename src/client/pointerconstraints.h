/**
 * @short Wrapper for the zwp_pointer_constraints_v1 interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the zwp_pointer_constraints_v1 interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the PointerConstraints interface:
 * @code
 * PointerConstraints *c = registry->createPointerConstraints(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the PointerConstraints and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * PointerConstraints *c = new PointerConstraints;
 * c->setup(registry->bindPointerConstraints(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The PointerConstraints can be used as a drop-in replacement for any zwp_pointer_constraints_v1
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry

     * sends a locked event, reported by {@link LockedPointer::locked}.

     * constraints cannot ever be satisfied. It is thus possible to request a

     * raised.
     *
     * The intersection of the @p region passed with this request and the input
     * region of the @p surface is used to determine where the pointer must be
     * in order for the lock to activate. It is up to the compositor whether to
     * warp the pointer or require some kind of user interaction for the lock
     * to activate. If the @p region is null the surface input region is used.
     *
     * A Surface may receive pointer focus without the lock being activated.
     *
     * Note that while a pointer is locked, the Pointer objects of the
     * corresponding seat will not emit any {@link Pointer::motion} signals, but
     * relative motion events will still be emitted via {@link RelativePointer::relativeMotion}.
     * Pointer axis and button events are unaffected.
