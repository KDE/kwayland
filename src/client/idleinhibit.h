/**
 * @short Wrapper for the zwp_idle_inhibit_manager_v1 interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the zwp_idle_inhibit_manager_v1 interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the IdleInhibitManager interface:
 * @code
 * IdleInhibitManager *c = registry->createIdleInhibitManager(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the IdleInhibitManager and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * IdleInhibitManager *c = new IdleInhibitManager;
 * c->setup(registry->bindIdleInhibitManager(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The IdleInhibitManager can be used as a drop-in replacement for any zwp_idle_inhibit_manager_v1
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry
 * @since 5.41

 * also blocked from displaying.
 *
 * If the Surface is destroyed, unmapped, becomes occluded, loses visibility, or otherwise
 * becomes not visually relevant for the user, the IdleInhibitor will not be honored by
 * the compositor; if the Surface subsequently regains visibility the inhibitor takes effect
 * once again.
 * Likewise, the IdleInhibitor isn't honored if the system was already idled at the time the
 * IdleInhibitor was established, although if the system later de-idles and re-idles the
 * IdleInhibitor will take effect.
