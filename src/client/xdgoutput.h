 * @short Wrapper for the zxdg_output_manager_v1 interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the zxdg_output_manager_v1 interface.
 *
 * This provides the logical size of the output. This is useful in case it doesn't match the
 * pixelSize / outputScale.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the XdgOutputManager interface:
 * @code
 * XdgOutputManager *c = registry->createXdgOutputManager(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the XdgOutputManager and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * XdgOutputManager *c = new XdgOutputManager;
 * c->setup(registry->bindXdgOutputManager(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The XdgOutputManager can be used as a drop-in replacement for any zxdg_output_manager_v1
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @since 5.47
 *
 * @see Registry
