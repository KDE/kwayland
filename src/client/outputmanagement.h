/**
* @short Wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_outputmanagement interface.
*
* This class provides a convenient wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_outputmanagement interface.
*
* To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
* possible ways to create the OutputManagement interface:
* @code
* OutputManagement *c = registry->createOutputManagement(name, version);
* @endcode
*
* This creates the OutputManagement and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
* can also be done in a more low level way:
* @code
* OutputManagement *c = new OutputManagement;
* c->setup(registry->bindOutputManagement(name, version));
* @endcode
*
* The OutputManagement can be used as a drop-in replacement for any org_kde_kwin_outputmanagement
* pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
*
* @see Registry
* @since 5.5
