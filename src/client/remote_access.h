/**
 * @short Wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_remote_access_manager interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_remote_access_manager interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the RemoteAccessManager interface:
 * @code
 * RemoteAccessManager *c = registry->createRemoteAccessManager(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the RemoteAccessManager and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * RemoteAccessManager *c = new RemoteAccessManager;
 * c->setup(registry->bindRemoteAccessManager(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The RemoteAccessManager can be used as a drop-in replacement for any org_kde_kwin_remote_access_manager
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry
