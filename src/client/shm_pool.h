/**
 * @short Wrapper class for wl_shm interface.
 *
 * This class holds a shared memory pool together with the Wayland server.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create a ShmPool instance:
 * @code
 * ShmPool *s = registry->createShmPool(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the ShmPool and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * ShmPool *s = new ShmPool;
 * s->setup(registry->bindShm(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The ShmPool holds a memory-mapped file from which it provides Buffers.
 * All Buffers are held by the ShmPool and can be reused. Whenever a Buffer
 * is requested the ShmPool tries to reuse an existing Buffer. A Buffer can
 * be reused if the following conditions hold
 * @li it's no longer marked as used
 * @li the server released the buffer
 * @li the size matches
 * @li the stride matches
 * @li the format matches
 *
 * The ownership of a Buffer stays with ShmPool. The ShmPool might destroy the
 * Buffer at any given time. Because of that ShmPool only provides QWeakPointer
 * for Buffers. Users should always check whether the pointer is still valid and
 * only promote to a QSharedPointer for a short time, e.g. to set new data.
 *
 * The ShmPool can provide Buffers for different purposes. One can create a Buffer
 * from an existing QImage. This will use a Buffer with same size, stride and image
 * format as the QImage and <b>copy</b> the content of the QImage into the Buffer.
 * The memory is <b>not</b> shared:
 * @code
 * QImage image(24, 24, QImage::Format_ARG32);
 * image.fill(Qt::transparent);
 * Buffer::Ptr buffer = s->createBuffer(image);
 * @endcode
 *
 * It is also possible to create a Buffer and copy the content from a generic location.
 * Like above this doesn't share the content but copies it:
 * @code
 * QImage image(24, 24, QImage::Format_ARG32);
 * image.fill(Qt::transparent);
 * Buffer::Ptr buffer = s->createBuffer(image.size(), image.bytesPerLine(), image.constBits());
 * @endcode
 *
 * Last but not least it is possible to get a Buffer without copying content directly to it.
 * This means an empty area is just reserved and can be used to e.g. share the memory with a
 * QImage:
 * @code
 * const QSize size = QSize(24, 24);
 * const int stride = size.width() * 4;
 * Buffer::Ptr buffer = s->getBuffer(size, stride, Buffer::Format::RGB32);
 * if (!buffer) {
 *     qDebug() << "Didn't get a valid Buffer";
 *     return;
 * }
 * QImage image(buffer.toStrongRef()->address(), size.width(), size.height(), stride, QImage::Format_RGB32);
 * image.fill(Qt::black);
 * @endcode
 *
 * A Buffer can be attached to a Surface:
 * @code
 * Compositor *c = registry.createCompositor(name, version);
 * Surface *s = c->createSurface();
 * s->attachBuffer(buffer);
 * s->damage(QRect(QPoint(0, 0), size));
 * @endcode
 *
 * Once a Buffer is attached to a Surface and the Surface is committed, it might be released
 * by the Wayland server and thus is free to be reused again. If the client code wants to
 * continue using the Buffer it must call Buffer::setUsed on it. This is important if the memory
 * is shared for example with a QImage as the memory buffer for a QImage must remain valid
 * throughout the life time of the QImage:
 * @code
 * buffer.toStrongRef()->setUsed(true);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This is also important for the case that the shared memory pool needs to be resized.
 * The ShmPool will automatically resize if it cannot provide a new Buffer. During the resize
 * all existing Buffers are unmapped and any shared objects must be recreated. The ShmPool emits
 * the signal poolResized() after the pool got resized.
 *
