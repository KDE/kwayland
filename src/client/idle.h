/**
 * @short Wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_idle interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_idle interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the Idle interface:
 * @code
 * Idle *m = registry->createIdle(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the Idle and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * Idle *m = new Idle;
 * m->setup(registry->bindIdle(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The Idle can be used as a drop-in replacement for any org_kde_kwin_idle
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry
