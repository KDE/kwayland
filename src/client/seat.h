/**
 * @short Wrapper for the wl_seat interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the wl_seat interface.
 * It's main purpose is to provide the interfaces for Keyboard, Pointer and Touch.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the Seat interface:
 * @code
 * Seat *s = registry->createSeat(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the Seat and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * Seat *s = new Seat;
 * s->setup(registry->bindSeat(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The Seat can be used as a drop-in replacement for any wl_seat
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry
 * @see Keyboard
 * @see Pointer
