/**
 * @short Wrapper for the org_kde_plasma_virtual_desktop_management interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the org_kde_plasma_virtual_desktop_management interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the PlasmaVirtualDesktopManagement interface:
 * @code
 * PlasmaVirtualDesktopManagement *c = registry->createPlasmaVirtualDesktopManagement(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the PlasmaVirtualDesktopManagement and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * PlasmaVirtualDesktopManagement *c = new PlasmaVirtualDesktopManagement;
 * c->setup(registry->bindPlasmaVirtualDesktopManagement(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The PlasmaVirtualDesktopManagement can be used as a drop-in replacement for any org_kde_plasma_virtual_desktop_management
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 * @since 5.52
 *
 * @see Registry
