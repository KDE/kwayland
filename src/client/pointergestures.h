/**
 * @short Wrapper for the zwp_pointer_gestures_v1 interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the zwp_pointer_gestures_v1 interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the PointerGestures interface:
 * @code
 * PointerGestures *c = registry->createPointerGestures(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the PointerGestures and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * PointerGestures *c = new PointerGestures;
 * c->setup(registry->bindPointerGestures(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The PointerGestures can be used as a drop-in replacement for any zwp_pointer_gestures_v1
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
