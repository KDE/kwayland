/**
 * @short Wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_outputmanagement interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the org_kde_kwin_outputmanagement interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the OutputManagement interface:
 * @code
 * OutputManagement *c = registry->createOutputManagement(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the OutputManagement and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * OutputManagement *c = new OutputManagement;
 * c->setup(registry->bindOutputManagement(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The OutputManagement can be used as a drop-in replacement for any org_kde_kwin_outputmanagement
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry
 * @since 5.5
