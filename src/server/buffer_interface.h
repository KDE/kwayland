     * If the BufferInterface does not reference a shared memory buffer a null QImage is returned.

     * The QImage shares the memory with the buffer and this constraints how the returned
     * QImage can be used and when this method can be invoked.
     *
     * It is not safe to have two shared memory QImages for different BufferInterfaces at
     * the same time. This method ensures that this does not happen and returns a null
     * QImage if a different BufferInterface's data is still mapped to a QImage. Please note
     * that this also applies to all implicitly data shared copies.
     *
     * In case it is needed to keep a copy, a deep copy has to be performed by using QImage::copy.
     *
     * As the underlying shared memory buffer is owned by a different client it is not safe to
     * write to the returned QImage. The image is a read-only buffer. If there is need to modify
     * the image, perform a deep copy.
